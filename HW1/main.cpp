//UMN CSCI 5607 2D Geometry Library Homework Test Harness [HW0]
// For this assignment you will implement several basic operations of
// 2D geometry. A list of functions to complete is in geom_lib_2d.h.
// This file shows example usage of those functions.

//To compile: g++ -fsanitize=address -g -std=c++11 main.cpp -o geom_test

#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS //Needed for MSVC to allow printf()
